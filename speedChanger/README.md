# SpeedChanger

_Change the playback rate on embedded videos that do not have speed controls_

## How to use this script

_tested in Firefox and Chrome_

1. Open the inspector on your browser (tested in FireFox and Chrome). Click into the Console tab.
2. Copy the contents of adjustPlaybackRate.js. Paste it into the Console (after the `>>` prompt) and hit enter. The default speed adjustment is 1.5x. You can change this by changing the number in the last line of the script.
3. If you need to, you can use the up arrow in the console to bring the script up (or just paste the script in again) and adjust the number; click enter to make it take effect.
4. To stop using the script, just refresh the page.


Notes:

- If you need to, you can use the up arrow in the console to bring the script up (or just paste the script in again) and adjust the number; click enter to make it take effect.
- To change the rate to normal (1x), change the number to 1.
- You may see degraded streaming quality (skipping, video/audio out of sync), especially at speeds over 1.5.
